# Koinos Contract Examples

This repo contains several example Koinos smart contracts. They are referenced by [docs.koinos.io](https://docs.koinos.io) and are a great place to get started both using Koinos and writing your own smart contracts.

You can either build the contracts using the Koinos CDT Docker image, or via the provided cmake project. To build using the cmake project, copy `.cpp` files in to `src` and `.proto` files in to `types`. The rest of the instructions can be found [here](https://docs.koinos.io/quickstart/contract-developer-guide.html).
